Add an Identity Provider by using the API
=========================================

.. note::

    We recommend that you use the Control Panel to add Identity Providers
    (see :ref:`add-idp-cp-gs-ug`), but advanced users might choose to use the
    Identity API instead.

To use the API to create and manage your Identity Providers, see the
`Identity Providers <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-identity/v2/api-reference/identity-provider-operations/>`_
section of the `Identity API Reference <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-identity/v2/api-reference/>`_.

Following are some important things to consider when you create an |idp| by
using the API:

- The |idp| must first be created by using a metadata XML file
- After the |idp| is created, you can update the **Description** and **Name**
  values.
- The **Name** value is the equivalent of the **Login Domain** referenced
  in :ref:`add-idp-cp-gs-ug`.
